# Time Logger
The idea of this app is to give the user full visibility on how they spend their time, the main page of the app is a dashboard with a stacked bar chart showing the total number of time units logged and the ditribution amongst the user's chosen projects.

The reason "work units" were chosen over logging hours and minutes is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) where the user will periodically work and take breaks to their own preferred ratio.

Once a basic wokring version is finished, the idea is to introduce functionality to present the user with statistics and patterns based on the time they have logged. Awards will also be introduced and saved to each given work day when the user has exceeded in a particular maner. The intent being to gamify the experience.
