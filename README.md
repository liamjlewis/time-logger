# Time Logger
This app is being developed to give the user full visibility on how they spend their time. The user will log units of time they have spent on various projects. The main page of the app is a dashboard with a stacked bar chart showing the total number of time units logged and the distribution amongst the user's chosen projects.

The reason "work units" were chosen over logging hours and minutes is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) where the user will periodically work and take breaks to their own preferred ratio.

Once a basic working version is finished, the plan is to introduce functionality to present the user with statistics and patterns based on the time they have logged. Awards will also be introduced and saved to each given work day when the user has exceeded in a particular manner. The intent being to gamify the experience.
